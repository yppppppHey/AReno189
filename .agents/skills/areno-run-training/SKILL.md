description: Run, configure, retry, and validate AReno SFT, DPO, GSPO, GRPO, PPO, and agentic training. Use for training commands, dataset or reward setup, smoke validation, real-step execution, checkpoint saving, or failed training retries. Do not use for serving-only tasks or framework implementation work.

# Run AReno Training

Read repository `AGENTS.md`, `CODEMAP.md`, and current `areno train --help` before building a command.

For remote model or dataset references, explicitly pass
`--model-hub modelscope`. Do not substitute a Hugging Face download when the
ModelScope asset is missing; request a valid ModelScope ID or local path.

## Select the path

Read [references/algorithm-matrix.md](references/algorithm-matrix.md). Inspect a bounded dataset sample with:

```bash
python .agents/skills/areno-run-training/scripts/inspect_dataset.py \
  --dataset-path <path-or-ref> --model-hub modelscope \
  [--loader examples/.../dataset_loader.py] --algo <algo>
```

Do not build or run the training command until this inspection returns
`"ok": true`. If raw rollout rows lack `prompt` or `messages`, select a
dataset loader and rerun the inspection with `--loader`; pass the same path to
training as `--dataset-loader-fn`. For GSM8K-style `question`/`answer` rows,
use `examples/math/dataset_loader.py`.

Use [scripts/read_metrics.py](scripts/read_metrics.py) to inspect event keys or selected scalar series. Do not parse stdout as the metric source.

## Workflow

1. Record `git rev-parse HEAD`, environment facts from `areno env --json` and `areno check`, GPU state, checkpoint source, ModelScope dataset source, and resolved local paths.
2. Classify SFT, DPO, rollout RL, or agentic RL. Read [references/data-contracts.md](references/data-contracts.md).
3. Inspect both the raw schema and the normalized schema. Treat a missing rollout `prompt`/`messages` as a required-loader error, not a warning.
4. Build the smallest command expressing the requested real workload. Preserve user-provided `max_new_tokens` and `max_context_len`, and include the verified loader with `--dataset-loader-fn`.
5. Use smoke or tune only when useful. Smoke is capacity evidence, not task completion.
6. For structured progress tracking, add `--progress text` (TTY/ci output) or `--progress jsonl --progress-output <path>` (for dashboard consumption) to the training command. The `--progress disabled` default provides zero overhead.
7. Run the real job. Confirm the requested trainer step advances. For rollout, inspect one coherent sample and reward.
8. On failure, use [references/failure-triage.md](references/failure-triage.md). Fix the first causal error.
9. If saving is requested, verify output and reload it through the intended adapter.

## Capacity invariants

- `batch_size * n_samples` is total sample demand; `max_running_prompts` is concurrent active capacity.
- Rollout memory follows cache/context/concurrency. Train memory follows `mini_bs`, sequence length, activation and optimizer state.
- `--drop-rollout-state` changes lifecycle memory, not task semantics.
- Reduce concurrency or microbatch before semantic token limits.

## Completion evidence

Report command, commit, model/dataset, topology, observed step and key metrics, plus save/reload evidence when required. Model load or smoke alone is not completion.

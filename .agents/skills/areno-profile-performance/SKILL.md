name: areno-profile-performance
description: Measure and diagnose AReno rollout, prefill, decode, training, checkpoint, role-switch, communication, or Python scheduling performance. Use when throughput or step time is slow and evidence from metrics, py-spy, or Nsight is required. Do not optimize before correctness is established.

# Profile AReno Performance

Profile a bounded, representative train or serve workload. Collect low-overhead
time, GPU, process, and TensorBoard evidence first; use sampling or tracing only
after those signals identify the subsystem to inspect.

```bash
python .agents/skills/areno-profile-performance/scripts/monitor_gpu.py \
  --pid <areno-pid> --duration 60 --output /tmp/areno-gpu.jsonl
python .agents/skills/areno-profile-performance/scripts/monitor_process.py \
  --pid <areno-pid> --duration 60 --output /tmp/areno-process.jsonl
python .agents/skills/areno-profile-performance/scripts/summarize_monitor.py \

```

## Workflow

1. Record workload, commit, model, topology, token lengths, concurrency, GPU, and dependency versions.
2. If the job was launched with `--progress jsonl`, read the progress JSONL file (default path: `<metrics-log-dir>/progress.jsonl`) to determine current stage and any failures before attaching profilers.
3. Find the parent AReno PID and monitor its process tree. For train jobs, attach during at least two post-warmup steps. For serve jobs, use a fixed request set and concurrency.
4. Capture per-GPU utilization, memory, power, and target-process memory. Memory capacity, compute utilization, and throughput are separate signals.
5. For train, list TensorBoard scalar names before selecting series. Summarize stage time, tokens/throughput, communication, optimizer, loss, and memory metrics that actually exist; do not assume fixed tags.
6. For serve, measure TTFT and total request latency with streaming enabled while the GPU and process monitors run. Record prompt/output lengths and active concurrency.
7. Exclude initialization, checkpoint load, compilation, and CUDA graph capture from steady-state conclusions, but report them separately when startup is the problem.
8. Use `py-spy record -p <pid> -o /tmp/areno.svg --duration 30` for Python scheduling, data processing, serialization, blocking I/O, or compilation orchestration.
9. Use a bounded Nsight Systems capture for GPU compute, communication, synchronization, allocator activity, or launch gaps. Read [references/profile-policy.md](references/profile-policy.md).
10. Compare baseline and candidate with identical workloads and multiple steady-state observations, then re-run correctness validation after optimization.

Report raw workload metadata, selected window, GPU peak/average memory and utilization, process CPU/RSS, stage breakdown or TTFT/latency, bottleneck evidence, profiler overhead, and before/after metrics. A single warmup step is not a benchmark.
